Following commands were 
What is my IP address configuration?
Can you show me the network interfaces and their IP addresses?
Can you ping google.com to check the internet connection?
What is the hostname of this machine?
Can you tell me the name assigned to this computer?
Can you trace the route to google.com?
I'd like to see the path taken by packets to reach google.com.

	What is a modem, and what is its primary function?
	How does a modem differ from a router?
	What types of modems are available (e.g., DSL, cable, fiber)?
How does a modem convert digital signals into analog signals and vice versa?
How does a modem synchronize with an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?
What is the application layer in the OSI model, and how does it differ from other layers?
Explain the key functions of the application layer in detail with examples.
Describe the working of the application layer in the OSI model. How does it communicate with the lower layers?
List and explain any five application layer protocols, including their purposes and real-world examples.
Compare and contrast the functions of DNS and HTTP as application layer protocols.
What is the primary difference between symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption, and in which scenarios is each typically used?
How does key management differ between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and why is key distribution a challenge in symmetric encryption?
Explain how encryption and decryption work in symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA). Provide examples of common algorithms for each type.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of symmetric encryption compared to asymmetric encryption in terms of performance, security, and scalability?


In a real-world system like HTTPS or email encryption (e.g., PGP), how are symmetric and asymmetric encryption used together to provide secure communication?
